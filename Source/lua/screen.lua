--- A Screen contains all necessary code to present a part of the program fullscreen,
--- eg. a level select screen, or gameplay or game-over screen
class("Screen").extends()

function Screen:update()
    -- no-op, implemented in subclasses
end

--- Notify screen that it will be hidden.
--- Only called when it might be resumed later.
--- (ie. only when another screen is pushed over it; not when it is popped off the backstack)
function Screen:pause()
    -- no-op, implemented in subclasses
end

--- Notify screen that it is visible to the user,
--- either for the first time or after it was paused
--- and subsequently brought back to the front of the backstack
function Screen:resume()
    -- no-op, implemented in subclasses
end

--- Called when this screen is popped off the stack. It will never be resumed,
--- So this is a good place for freeing up RAM, cleanup, etc.
function Screen:destroy()
    -- no-op, implemented in subclasses
end

function Screen:debugDraw()
    -- no-op, implemented in subclasses
end
