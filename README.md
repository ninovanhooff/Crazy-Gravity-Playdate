# Gravity Express

This game is based on [Crazy Gravity for Playstation Portable](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Crazy_Gravity_Portable_PSP), which in turn
is based on [the PC version](https://www.xlmsoft.de/crazygravity.php) by Axel Meierhöfer. \
Axel Meierhöfer gave written permission to use the sounds and graphics of the original game.

Note that you may run the project and use the start and level select screens, but levels are not included in this project.

To support the project, buy [the game on Itch.io](https://ninovanhooff.itch.io/gravity-express).

## Development

This repository gives an insight in how a playdate game with multiple screens could be set up. 
All level files are in a private repository though. If you want to have access to the level files too,
please support this project by buying the game on Itch.io and copy the `levels` folder into the 
`Source` directory of this project
